# Integral-Unraveler-using-MATLAB

This is a program created by me and Matthew Shih to evaluate the integrals of an equation as well as graph them.

How to use:

1. type in the right side of the equation (E.g '4*x', 'exp(x)')

2. Press 1,2,3, or 4 based on the option you want <br /> 
   Option '1': Indefinite integral returns a integral of the equation <br />
   Option '2': Definite integral returns a definite integral using 2 chosen bounds <br />
   Option '3': Graph of function <br />
   Option '4': Change function allows you to change your current equation <br />

3. Repeat or press 'q' to end the program.
